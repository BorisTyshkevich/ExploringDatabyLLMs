Use `ontime.ontime` as the primary fact table for flight operations.

Use `ontime.airports_latest` for current airport reference data such as:

- `code`
- `name`
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- `utc_local_time_variation`

`ontime.airports_latest` can be used directly to get coordinates and other columns for enrichment in application code (such as JavaScript or python)
or used for SQL JOINs.

Preferred sql joins:

- `ontime.ontime.OriginAirportID = ontime.airports_latest.airport_id`
- `ontime.ontime.DestAirportID = ontime.airports_latest.airport_id`

For `ontime.ontime`, use `OriginAirportID` and `DestAirportID` when enriching airport names, coordinates, or other airport attributes inside SQL.
Do not join `ontime.ontime` legs directly to `ontime.airports_latest` by airport code when the airport id columns are already available.

Fallback sql joins:

- use `ontime.ontime.Origin = ontime.airports_latest.code`
- use `ontime.ontime.Dest = ontime.airports_latest.code`

Airport codes are not guaranteed to be unique in `ontime.airports_latest`.
If a code-based lookup is unavoidable, first reduce `ontime.airports_latest` to one deterministic row per `code` in a subquery before joining.

Use the `airport_id` joins when those columns are available.
Use code-based joins only when the analytical result exposes route strings or airport codes but not airport IDs.

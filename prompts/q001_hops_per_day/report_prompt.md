### main
Find the longest itineraries with the highest number of hops for a single aircraft using the same flight number.
Define uniqueness by the full textual `Route` string and output the most recent top 10 unique routes by departure time.
Do not exclude rows solely because `Tail_Number` is empty. If an itinerary qualifies but the aircraft id is missing in the source data, keep it in the result and surface the aircraft id as empty / unknown rather than filtering it out.
Count hops from distinct same-day legs, not raw source rows; do not let duplicate or conflicting same-time rows inflate hop count or create artifact routes.

Return:

- aircraft id
- flight number
- carrier
- flight date
- hop count
- route recurrence count: total number of days across all history on which this exact Route string was flown by any aircraft
- textual `Route` in chronological order, including every origin and the final destination, using `-` as the delimiter throughout, for example `SMF-SAN-PHX-COS-DEN`

### q1
Do the top itineraries appear to be recurring scheduled patterns or mostly one-offs?

List the recurrence count for each of the 10 routes explicitly before summarizing any tiers or categories, and make sure any category totals add up to 10.

### q2
What geographic pattern do the top itineraries show?

Base the geographic answer only on the airports appearing in the 10 routes returned by `main`, not on the broader population of all maximum-hop flights in history.

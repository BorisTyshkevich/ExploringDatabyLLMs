- Do not emit result rows or any data output.
- Write the primary dashboard SQL to `main.sql`.
- Write one JSON object to `answer.raw.json`.

Write exactly this SQL file to `main.sql`:

`main.sql`

```sql
-- one SQL statement for the main question / primary dashboard query
```

Write exactly this JSON object shape to `answer.raw.json`:

{
  "subquestions": [
    {
      "subquestion": "Question text copied exactly from the required subquestion contract.",
      "answer_markdown": "A concise prose answer to that subquestion.",
      "sql": "-- one SQL statement that proves the answer"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:

- Write the main question / primary dashboard SQL to `main.sql`.
- Provide one proof query for each dashboard question.
- `main.sql` must contain executable SQL only, not Markdown fences.
- Write the artifact to `answer.raw.json`.
- The `answer.raw.json` file must contain raw JSON, not fenced Markdown.
- Read every bullet under `## Dashboard Questions` in the question-specific guidance below.
- Return one object in `subquestions` for every listed dashboard question, in the same order.
- Preserve the required `subquestion` text exactly.
- Each `answer_markdown` must directly answer that subquestion in concise prose.
- Each `sql` must be one executable SQL statement only and should serve as the proof query for that subquestion.
- Use one proof query per dashboard question. Do not merge several dashboard questions into one unioned or row-typed SQL result unless the question-specific guidance explicitly requires that.
- Derive SQL and answers only from the current question and the current query result shape.
- Do not rely on prior qforge runs, prior question ids, or previously observed values.
- Do not invent extra dashboard questions, custom scoring formulas, analysis windows, ranking rules, or business definitions unless the question-specific prompt explicitly asks for them.
- Use the full available dataset history unless the question-specific prompt explicitly asks for a narrower time window.
